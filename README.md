# AWS documentation 
This repository contains instructions for researchers within WCWH who use AWS.  

Everyone will use [connect to athena.md](connect-to-athena.md) to log into the AWS Athena 
query editor for the first time.  

Lab groups who upload data to the central database will additionally use 
[connect to S3](connect-to-s3.md) and [s3-upload-protocol](s3-upload-protocol.md)
